					Madeleine’s practice is research based and revolves around the artistic processes and creations born out of insights within the process of making. Her work often engages with satire and the absurd and bridges ideas of crafty and dignified art. Often, her work focuses on commentaries on technology and pop culture in the form of “personal” narrative. Through exposures in varying formats (photographic, mechanically-printed, hand-printed) and integrations of hand-drawn imagery, she unfolds the traditional “comic book” and presents narratives as extensions of story panels. Madeleine’s riso print “Sleepy Ottawa” is featured on this issue’s cover.
